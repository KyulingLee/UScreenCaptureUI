UScreenCaptureUI
================

A simple UI for Screen Capture DirectShow Source Filter (UScreenCapture) by Unreal Streaming Technologies.

It looks like UScreenCapture was abandoned by the developers and isn't available on official sources anymore, so this UI is just garbage now. Please look for a more complete software like [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/)

Binaries on `dist` folder.

Requirements
============

* .NET Framework v4.0 Client Profile
* UScreenCaptureUI pre-installed (will be detected with the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\UNREAL\Live\UScreenCapture` registry key)
